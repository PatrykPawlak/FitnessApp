### An Application supporting the management of your fitness training plan.

The application is used to manage your fitness training plan. Thanks to the application, the user will have a choice of ready training plans to choose from but also will be able to create his own training plan using exercises selected from the list or entered manually, to set up the time of the exercise and to determine the break between intervals. The big advantage of the application will be its scalability, so it will be possible to add new functionality in the future. Thanks to the possibility of designing the application for many platforms, the application will also be available as a web application.
